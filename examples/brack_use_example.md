## QUESTION:
``` Prompt
You are a symbolic interpreter for the Brack Rosetta method.

CONTRACT
1) Execute Brack by simulation (no hidden state). Every reply must:
   - Re-state current environment/bindings you used.
   - Show a short step-by-step trace.
   - Return a final result object.

2) Bracket roles (strict):
   [ … ] = values/lists
   ( … ) = function/call
   { … } = block/scope
   < … > = type/metadata

3) Type system & checks:
   - Use <int>, <float>, <bool>, <string>, <list <type>>, <tuple …>, <any>.
   - Implement (type-check [expr <type>]) ⇒
       [ok <type>]  OR  {error type-mismatch [expected <type>] [actual <inferred-type>]}
   - Infer types from values when missing.

4) Execution etiquette:
   - Be deterministic. If input is ambiguous, state the assumption you chose.
   - No side effects; `(print …)` just echoes in the trace.
   - No persistent memory: each turn only uses the data in the current message.

OUTPUT SHAPE (always):
{
  trace: [ ...brief steps... ],
  env:   { ...key bindings you used... },
  result: <your final value or error>
}

Confirm you understand, then run the following computation:

## BEGIN BRACK CODE
{
  (let [v0 30.0])                     // m/s
  (let [theta 0.78539816339])         // rad (~45°)
  (let [g 9.80665])                   // m/s^2

  // Minimal unit tags
  (let [U <tuple <m> <s> <kg>>])      // sketch; symbolic only

  // Derived formula: R = v0^2 * sin(2θ) / g
  (let [two_theta (* [2.0 theta])])
  (let [sin2theta (sin [two_theta])])
  (let [num (* [(* [v0 v0]) sin2theta])])
  (let [R (/ [num g])])

  (type-check [v0 <float>])
  (type-check [theta <float>])
  (type-check [g <float>])
  (type-check [R <float>])

  (return [R])
}
## END BRACK CODE
```

## Real‑world picture: a level‑field kick

Imagine you’re on a flat soccer field with no wind. You kick the ball at about 67 mph (that’s what v0 = 30.0 meters/second means) and you aim it at roughly 45° (theta ≈ 0.785… radians is just another way to say 45°). The code answers one question:

*How far will the ball travel along the ground before it lands?
(assuming level ground, same launch and landing height, and no air resistance)*

Calculating projectile range

OK, let me see. I’m figuring out projectile range using the Brack Rosetta method. I’m pinpointing angles and force for exact calculations.

Verifying results

I checked the trace and environment to align with outlined specifications, ensuring a ```tie<facc>m``` in formatting.

Clarifying the result

I reviewed variable setups, numerical precision, and result formatting. Ensuring type checks and adhering to trace object requirements, I whittled down the final result.

Clarifying the trace

I ensured accurate representation of results, maintained proper JSON formatting, and avoided unnecessary details like step verifying difficulty or dimension mentions. >

## Line‑by‑line, in everyday terms

**1) Set the knowns**

```v0 = 30.0 → “Initial speed of the kick is 30 m/s (~67 mph).”```

```theta = 0.785398… → “Launch angle is about 45°.”```

```g = 9.80665 → “Gravity’s pull on Earth.”```

```(Optional) Units tag```

```U = <tuple <m> <s> <kg>> → “A reminder of the kinds of units we care about (meters, seconds, kilograms). It’s a label, not used in the math here.”```

**2) Work the standard range formula**

*The textbook rule for ideal projectile range is*
```Range = (launch speed)² × sin(2 × angle) ÷ gravity```

```two_theta = 2 × theta → “Double the angle because the formula needs 2θ.”```

```sin2theta = sin(two_theta) → “Take the sine of that doubled angle.”```

```At 45°, doubling gives 90°; sin(90°) = 1, which is the best possible value, meaning a 45° launch is most efficient for distance (in this simplified world).```

```num = (v0 × v0) × sin2theta → “Square the speed, then apply the angle efficiency.”```

```R = num ÷ g → “Divide by gravity to get the range.”```

**3) Sanity checks**

*The (type-check …) lines just confirm everything is a decimal number (a “float”). Think of them as “did we accidentally pass a word where a number should be?” guards.*

**4) Return the answer**

*It hands back the computed range R.*

## Result:
*If you kicked a ball* at ~67 mph and ~45° on a calm, flat field; *under idealized physics*, it would fly *about 92 meters* (~301 ft, 100.4 yd) before touching down.
